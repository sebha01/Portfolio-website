                <h3>What makes this game unique</h3>
                <p>
                    Sploot is made unique by the dialogue interactions with NPCs, 
                    creating life within the world of the game. NPCs are alive, move 
                    around, and can be interacted with, which adds an immersive 
                    experience. Additionally, enemies drop collectibles upon defeat, 
                    giving players the chance to recover their health or get one step 
                    closer to completing a quest. The quest system guides players 
                    through objectives, giving meaning to the actions the player is 
                    being asked to do and providing a sense of adventure.

                <h3>The Good</h3>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the work I produced and the consistency of my work 
                    ethic, especially after a previous project where I had to make the 
                    difficult decision to terminate it earlier than planned. Despite 
                    challenges, I maintained a steady rate of work, which reassured me
                     that I have the confidence to tackle future projects, even if they
                      don’t go to plan. One significant improvement in this project, 
                      compared to previous ones, was the inclusion of proper planning 
                      from the start. Earlier projects suffered from a lack of 
                      structure, often leaving players wandering aimlessly without 
                      clear direction or music, which made the experience boring 
                      quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I managed to work well within the project’s scope, completing all 
                    the essential features before experimenting with new mechanics. 
                    This allowed me to expand on the game with a quest system, 
                    collectibles, and interactive NPC dialogue.
                </p>

                <h3>The Bad</h3>
                <p>
                    Illness at the time limited the amount of work I could complete, 
                    which slowed progress at certain points. Working solo on this 
                    project highlighted the benefits of having teammates. Collaborating
                     with others could have provided valuable second opinions and 
                     allowed me to improve certain aspects of the game.
                </p>

                <h3>The things I would do differently next time</h3>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would look to work in a team, ultimately 
                    strengthening the result. I also want to use a roadmap when working
                     on solo projects to ensure I maintain a clear direction and don’t 
                     spend too much time on one part of the project.
                </p>
