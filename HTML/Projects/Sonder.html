                <h3>What makes this game unique</h3>
                <p>
                    Sonder Reflections has a dialogue system that considers the choices you make and affects the result you get in the 
                    end and is a narrative driven project instead of one that focuses purely on mechanics. Models and music made by the 
                    members of the team instead of being sourced externally.
                </p>

                <h3>The Good</h3>
                <p>
                    The teamwork was enjoyable due amount of communication there was with a majority of the team members with morale high 
                    during our crunch period for the project and we had direct input and provided suggestions for other team members to due 
                    to being in calls and close contact. Massive collaboration between us to complete this project as well as planning 
                    massively reduced clashes and halts in development down the line as we already had a set plan and work to do so we 
                    never had to go back to the drawing board for extensive periods of time. We had a lot of backup options in place for 
                    anything that went wrong and killed our darlings and removed features that would only pile on workload, in the end we kept 
                    everything that portrayed the message of what Sonder Reflections as a game was meant to feel like.
                </p>

                <h3>The Bad</h3>
                <p>
                    Timing for work to be completed, everything was crunched within the last week because that was the only time we had to 
                    be able to work on the project.
                </p>

                <h3>The things I would do differently next time</h3>
                <p>
                    I would keep the team smaller as we could create a more focused effort in a smaller group with better consistency.
                     I would also act sooner in terms of delegation of tasks and setting work for members of the team as a lot of it fell 
                     to me and at points it was pretty overwhelming as I would have multiple questions at once while doing my own role, 
                     although I did resolve this and broke down the massive amount of work into small attainable steps I didnâ€™t lean on 
                     others as soon as I should have and it was a massive headache trying to make sure everyone was on track and members 
                     were preoccupied with the next set of work if they had completed their task.
