                <h3>What makes this game unique</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is unique due to the fact you can dismember enemies,
                     the enemies also have ragdoll physics and fall when their health 
                     is depleted. The project also has multiple look and movement types
                     to account for motion sickness and user play styles, teleportation,
                      continuous movement, snap turning, continuous turning, ray 
                      interactors if userâ€™s have limited space. And lastly occlusion 
                      culling has been implemented to increase performance.
                </p>

                <h3>The Good</h3>
                <p>
                    For a first my first ever VR game I got functionality working with 
                    the headset done well and I managed to keep to a good time limit 
                    for each part of the project given the time I had. I also learnt 
                    optimisation techniques like reducing triangles in the map and 
                    occlusion culling so that the project could preform better.  
                </p>

                <h3>The Bad</h3>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of unfinished work, I got a basic game done but 
                    there was not that much polish. There was also little quality of 
                    gameplay, apart from moving around and shooting the enemies there 
                    was not much else and I crunched a very extreme amount, probably 
                    was not good for me health wise.
                </p>

                <h3>The things I would do differently next time</h3>
                <p>
                    I would cut the map down to a third of what it was, focus on a 
                    round system and scoring to keep the player interested, add story 
                    elements to add some depth to the gameplay and sort out the physics 
                    for the enemies when they get parts of them dismembered.
                </p>
